Load Average:

"Load average" refers to the average number of processes that are either:

actively using the CPU (running), or waiting to use the CPU (runnable state),over a specific time period.

If you have 4 cores:

Load average of 4.00 = fully utilized

Load average of 2.00 = 50% load

Load average of 6.00 = overloaded (50% more demand than capacity)

load average: 4.45, 4.75, 4.65

These three numbers represent the average system load over the last 1min - 4.45 load, 5 - 4.75 load, and 15 minutes - 4.65 load, respectively.
