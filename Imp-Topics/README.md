"Load average" refers to the average number of processes that are either:

actively using the CPU (running), or waiting to use the CPU (runnable state),over a specific time period.

load average: 0.45, 0.75, 0.65

These three numbers represent the average system load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.
